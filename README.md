# _Plexaura homomalla_ larval settlement choice
## K.J. Tonra and C.D. Wells

### This repository contains the data and analyses performed for the settlement choice experiment performed with _Plexaura homomalla_ planulae in July, 2019. The experiment was conducted at the Virgin Islands Environmental Resource Station (University of the Virgin Islands) on St. John, USVI. 

### Project summary
In complex marine habitats like the intertidal zone and coral reefs, the specific location where sessile organisms settle can determine whether they die or live to reproduce. Given the importance of this first decision, the process of habitat selection and settlement is frequently not random or passive. The goal of this project was to understand the effects of algal crusts on settlement location choice, the subsequent effects of different substratum types on mortality rates, and the scale on which octocoral larvae can sense differences and make decisions.
