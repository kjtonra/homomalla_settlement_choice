# _Plexaura homomalla_ larval settlement choice
## K.J. Tonra and C.D. Wells

### This repository contains the data and analyses performed for the settlement choice experiment performed with _Plexaura homomalla_ planulae in July, 2019. The experiment was conducted at the Virgin Islands Environmental Resource Station (University of the Virgin Islands) on St. John, USVI. 

### Project summary
In complex marine habitats like the intertidal zone and coral reefs, the specific location where sessile organisms settle can determine whether they die or live to reproduce. Given the importance of this first decision, the process of habitat selection and settlement is frequently not random or passive. The goal of this project was to understand the effects of algal crusts on settlement location choice, the subsequent effects of different substratum types on mortality rates, and the scale on which octocoral larvae can sense differences and make decisions. 


### File structure
#### data
This folder contains the .csv files associated with our analyses and results. There are three: 1. annotations.csv contains point count data from [CoralNet](https://coralnet.ucsd.edu/). This contains a row for each individual point that was annotated. 2. counts.csv contains data for each container and piece of rubble, including how many polyps were settled on each substratum type or rubble type. 3. areas.csv contains size data for each piece of rubble. We measured heights in the field and used photos of the top and bottom of each piece to find the perimeter and area of each side. These data are used for calculating the total surface area to be used in finding electivity indices.

#### analyses
This folder contains R script files with analyses that were used.
